# IR-VecotorSpace
A simple Search Engine based on the vector space model.
The document generator program randomly populates 10 text files with upper-case letters A-F. The vector-space program takes a query from user, on letter at a time, and retrieves the document that most matches the query based on the cosine smilarity function.
